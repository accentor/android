  pull request includes visual changes (which will probably be the
  case for anything that isn't a pure logic fix), please include
  screenshots showing those changes. Note that the GitHub ToS requires
  you to have the intellectual property rights required to post
  copyrighted content, which you might not have for cover art included
  in your screenshot depending on your jurisdiction and the license
